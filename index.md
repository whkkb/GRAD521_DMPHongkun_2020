# Data Description: 
The theme of the research project is the influence of drilling parameters on cortical bone drilling performance. The main content of this research is to use finite element simulation software to simulate the process of cortical bone drilling and to study the impact of drilling parameters on the entire process, to provide suggestions and references for future related medical research. 
In this research, the main data types are spreadsheets and 3D models. The two types of data include data sets and their collection methods are: 
a)	Drill diameter, drill rotation speed and drill feed speed. These three data sets are the input data of the research, and they are directly measured in the laboratory and stored in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.
b)	Drilling force. This data set is the most important data for this experiment. It is the result of the simulation of the cortical bone drilling process using the finite element software ABAQUS, which is also imported into an Excel spreadsheet for storage. ABAQUS is a professional commercial finite element analysis software commonly used in the field of machinery analysis.
c)	Simulation process model. The simulation process model is a 3D model output after ABAQUS simulation. It is stored in the format of a binary ODB file that can only be opened with ABAQUS software.
In this study, the amount of the first three data is approximately 50KB-250KB, the amount of drilling force data will be around 500KB and the amount of simulation model data is about 1GB-5GB.
# Roles and responsibilities: 
  Since this research is a single senior student project, that is to say, there is only one senior student involved. Therefore, in this study, the student involved in the study will be responsible for ensuring that all data management plans will be implemented, and his/her research instructor will assist and supervise him/her.
	The key data management responsibilities in the project are data collection/data generation, data analysis, and archiving and preservation. The student needs to play all their roles in this single research project, and the tutor will provide some help to the students in data analysis and storage.
	If the senior student leaves or changes the research project, the research data may be deleted or backed up to the tutor to the new student in charge of the project according to the tutor’s request. If someone joins the study and manages the data, but leaves again, the senior student in charge of the study should ask the member to send all research data to the senior student and delete the relevant data in the member’s device before leaving.
# Data standards and metadata：
  The documentation of this research project does not use metadata standards. This study created an Excel model draft to record the simulation process data to be analyzed. The 3D simulation model was created in ABAQUS software. Each time the finite element simulation process is completed, a new version of the simulation result model will be generated. The difference in the versions of these simulation result models is due to changes in the values of the drill speed and drill feed speed as input values during the simulation. Because the dataset of the simulation model in this study does not need to be changed too much, the software is not used for version control. The method of distinguishing these different versions of the model is the file naming strategy so that the student doesn't need to open the file and see which version of the model directly. The name template is Model-vr1-vr2. Vr1 means drill rotation speed and vr2 means drill feed speed. For the research sample, the data of each simulation process will be recorded in a separate Excel template created. This facilitates data comparison and analysis. This part of the data includes four data: drill diameter, drill speed, drill feed rate and drilling force. The relevant parameters of the drill bit are measured from the laboratory, and the drilling force is the maximum value of the drilling force generated during the drilling process derived after the simulation by the ABAQUS software. The Excel model includes information about variables (such as units).
# Storage and security：
  During the project, the data will be stored on the research student's computer and the project instructor's computer, and a password is used to ensure its security. The data will be stored on the computer of the student and his/her tutor for two years. After the research is completed, they will be uploaded to the database of Tianjin University of Technology and stored permanently. There are two methods suitable for the backup of this research data. During the research period, all research data stored on the student’s computer will be automatically backed up to an external storage device (removable hard disk). After the research is completed, all the research data and content will be carved into two CDs, one of which will be handed over to the university and the other will be handed over to the teacher for backup. At the same time, the student should back up their research data to cloud storage every week to avoid losing external storage devices. External storage devices can also prevent cloud storage from being destroyed or lost. A standard file naming system will be used for all data. The specific method is to include the original name of the data and list different drill parameters in the data name to distinguish different versions of the data.
# Access and data sharing：
  In this research, there is a factor that limits the availability of shared data during the research process. According to Requirements for Graduation Thesis of Tianjin University of Technology, the 3D models and the parameters and results of experiments in the research cannot be shared with other students with similar research projects during the research process and can only be discussed when the tutor holds a student meeting. In order to prevent plagiarism, students can only share data with their tutors before the research and thesis defense are completed. After the research is completed and the defense is passed, there are no more factors that limit the availability of shared data.
  After the research project is completed, the research data in the research will be made public. All research data will be uploaded to the database of Tianjin University of Technology. The public can find relevant data here. Data sharing formats include Excel tables that provide research parameters and results in the form of .csv files; the finite element drilling model established by ABAQUS uses ODB files (binary file format, which can only be opened with ABAQUS software). Regarding the use, reuse and creation of derivative products, under the permission of this data set, anyone can freely research, apply, copy and/or modify the work or expression for any purpose. The identification of terms of use is Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0).
# Archiving and preservation：
  After the project ends, the folder containing all the data will be compressed and uploaded to the database of Tianjin University of Technology. At the same time, the student and his/her tutor also need to save them on their computer devices. In the database, the compressed folder will be kept permanently, and it will also be kept on the computer of the project instructor and the student for two years. The format of the compressed file package is a zip file. The data format in the compressed file package has been described in the previous section. Finally, the data can be accessed from the database of Tianjin University of Technology according to relevant needs.
