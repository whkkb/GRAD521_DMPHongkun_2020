# Data Description: The research topic is Study on The Influence of Drilling Parameters on Cortical Bone Drilling Performance. The main content of this research is to use finite element simulation software to simulate the process of cortical bone drilling and to study the impact of drilling parameters on the entire process, to provide suggestions and references for future related medical research. In this research, the most important data is the simulation results of cortical bone drilling process using finite element software. The finite element software used in the simulation process is ABAQUS, which can intuitively display the simulation results, and can store the result data as an Excel table according to the needs of users. In this study, the amount of the first three data is approximately 50KB-250KB, the amount of drilling force data will be around 500KB and the amount of simulation model data is about 1GB-5GB.
# Roles and responsibilities: The source of the research data is my undergraduate thesis, so this research was done by me alone. Therefore, in this research, I am responsible for ensuring that the data management plan will be implemented. The key data management responsibilities in the project is data collection/data generation, data analysis and archiving and preservation. Also, because the research was done by myself, I also played all these roles by myself. If I leave or change the research project, I will delete the research data or give it to the person who will take over the project. If someone joins my research and manages the data, but then leaves again, I will let him send all the research data to me and delete the relevant data in his device before leaving.
# Data standards and metadataï¼šDataset 1: Drill model. In this study, the model of the drill was built in SolidWorks software. In this experiment, the diameter of the drill bit is one of the variables that need to be controlled for the study, so for the drill model, the data that needs to be separately recorded and analyzed is the diameter of the drill model, which will be recorded in the Excel model I created. The drill model is distinguished by the file naming strategy. The name template is: Drill-xx. xx is the value of the drill diameter such as 5 and 10. Dataset 2: Simulation result model. The 3D simulation model was created in ABAQUS software. Each time the finite element simulation process is completed, a new version of the simulation result model will be generated. The difference in the versions of these simulation result models is due to changes in the values of the drill speed and drill feed speed as input values during the simulation. Because the dataset of the simulation model in this study does not need to be changed too much, the software is not used for version control. The method of distinguishing these different versions of the model is still the file naming strategy, so that I don't need to open the file and see which version of the model is directly. The name template is: Model-vr1-vr2. Vr1 means drill rotation speed and vr2 means drill feed speed. Dataset 3: research sample. I created an Excel template to collect this data. The data of each simulation process will be recorded in this Excel template. This is convenient for data comparison and analysis. This part of the data is the key data needed after the experiment is completed, including the diameter parameter in the drill bit model, the input value of the simulation process and the simulation result. Specifically, it includes four data: drill diameter, drill rotation speed, drill feed speed and drilling force. The Excel model includes information about variables such as units.
